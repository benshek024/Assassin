  In Stage 1, player are tasked with the assassination of a rival boss using a sniper rifle by killing all of the guards in his manor house to lure him out
  
  Stage 2 will be the player escaping rival enemies who are seeking revenge from him by fighting his way out after they have discovered the hiding location of the player. 

  Stage 3 was originally planned to require player to defend a warehouse from waves of enemy attack, but was scraped due to development time constrain. A short animation was played after Stage 2 to briefly showcase the idea of Stage 3.
